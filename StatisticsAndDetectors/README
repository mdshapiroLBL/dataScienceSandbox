#  README file for dataScienceSandbox/StatisticsAndDetectors
#  This is a sandbox for problems and examples of general interest for the
#  	upper division classes.
#
# Notes and examples
# 	Notes_logLikelihood:
#				This is a simple set of notes on logLikelihood
#				fits together with an example.  I'm afraid my
#				solution is in C++ but it would be easy to
#				migrate to python.
#
#	Example_decay:
#				This is a simple problem intended to provide an example
#				of how to generate random numbers according to a specified
#				distribution.  It should prepare them for the more complicated
#				simulation problems in the homework.
#
# Problem Sets
#	Homework_LogLikelihood:
#				 This might be useful for 111 lab, since it is
#				 so similar to muon decay.  I've given this
#				 problem to my Physics 226 students as a way
#				 of ensuring that the understand likelihood fits.
#
# 	Homework_DetectorResolution:
#				Again, I've used this in Physics 226 but I think
#				it would be useful in other contexts.  I would
#				certainly add it to the Physics 129 options and
#				it might also make sense for 111 lab.
#				I've been wondering if there should be a second
#				add-on problem which talks about track fitting.
#				I'll try to put something together.
#
#	Homework_EMShowers:
#				I'm interested in getting people's opinions on
#				this problem.  It is both too hard and too simpified.
#				The "too hard" part is that to do this, you need to
#				have some programming skills.  The too simplified
#				part is that the bremsstahlung and pair production
#				modeling is wrong (I state that explicitly in the problem).
#				Is this a bridge too far for upper division?  I use it in the grad
#				class
