  {\large\bf A Monte Carlo Simulation of Particle Decay}
\end{center}
\vskip0.2in
During an experiment, a beam of 10,000 B+ particles with lifetime of 1.638e-12 and mass
5.279 GeV start at x=0 and are travel in the +x-direction with momenta 
uniformly distributed between 10 and 20 GeV.  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Write a simple Monte Carlo to simulate the decays in this experiment.
 \item  Make a 1 dimensional histogram of the number of particles that decay 
 a function of x for x between 0 and 1 cm 
\item Make a profile plot of the mean decay distance as a function of 
B+ momentum (a profile plot gives the average value of one variable as a function
of another).  Do {\it not} impose the 1 cm maximum distance from part (b) for this plot.
\end{itemize}
