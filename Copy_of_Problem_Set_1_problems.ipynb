That is to say, we draw a cumulative probability $y$ for $x$ uniformly at random, then find that value of $x$ corresponding to this probability.  Since the CDF $F(x)$ must be real, nonnegative, and non-decreasing, and strictly increasing when, by assumption, $y = \\phi(x)$ is strictly monotonic, the function $G(y)$ will be invertible in principle.  The challenge in practice is usually to find an efficient way to calculate the inverse numerically.  \n",

If instead $\\phi(x)$ were decreasing, strictly speaking we should calculate $F^{-1}(1-y)$, but $y$ and $(1-y)$ are governed by the same uniform distribution, so we can actually use $x = F^{-1}(y)$ in either case.\n",
